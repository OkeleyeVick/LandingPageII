# LandingPageII

This is a page that centers around me trying to learn how use some javascript libraries for beauitful animations <br>
The Javascript Libraries include<br>
- [x] Animate on scroll
- [x] Anime.js
- [x] Animate.js
- [x] Animate.css
- [x] GSAP <br>
Please be aware that I have a lot to work on right here as I haven't hosted it yet nor added the animations either :sweat_smile: <br>

> It needs to be responsive too and refactored, but I have been uptight and busy as much
> Na me get repository to update, no vex... and if you vex, na you sabi :smirk:
> Thank you checking this repo out nevertheless <br>


I'll update the repo as soon as I can and leave link in the description for y'all to see where I hosted it live, till then <br>
